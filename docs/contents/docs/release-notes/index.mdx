## Wishlist
Here's a list of what to expect in future releases of Shellviz:
- **Filter your data**: Filter tables and log files to only show filtered data. Initialize or update filters from the command line
- **Progressive Web App**: Ideally, Shellviz can be installed as a PWA on a mobile device or desktop, complete with offline support. This would make it even easier to launch the Shellviz client.
