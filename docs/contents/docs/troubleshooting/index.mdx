## Browser can't connect to Shellviz
Is your browser not able to load the Shellviz instance? The most common reason for this is the server prematurely shutting down. Shellviz runs a local web server as long as the `Shellviz()` instance is alive, but this server will be killed as soon as your instance is destroyed. 

Try launching a python shell from your command line and initializing an instance of Shellviz from there. Make sure not to terminate the python shell before attempting your connection

```python
# run this code from within a `python` or `ipython` interactive shell
import shellviz
shellviz.Shellviz()
# now, try connecting to the displayed url in your browser before terminating the interactive shell session
```

## Missing data
The most likely cause of missing data is the Shellviz server terminating before it has been able to send data to the browser. To fix this, you can use the `wait()` command:

```python
sv = Shellviz()
sv.wait()
```

You can learn more about the wait() command on the [waiting until data is viewed](/docs/getting-started#waiting-until-data-is-viewed) section of the Getting Started guide.
