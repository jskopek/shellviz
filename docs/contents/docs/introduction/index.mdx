Shellviz is a Python package that allows you to visualize and explore your data. It creates a local server that can receive and visualize data from your Python scripts. It's open source, has no dependencies, and doesn't require any configuration, sign-up, or API key to use. Just type something like:

```python
from shellviz import log, table, json
log('my first shellviz command')
# Shellviz serving on http://192.168.86.124:5544
table([("Alice", 25, 5.6), ("Bob", 30, 5.9), ("Charlie", 22, 5.7)])
json({"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "height": 5.6})
```

Launch the local web server, and you'll see this:
