## Initializing Server Manually
If you would like Shellviz to run locally, or you would like to adjust the parameters, you can initialize it directly:


```python
from shellviz import Shellviz
sv = Shellviz(port=3333, show_url=False)
sv.log('hello world')
```
```javascript
import ShellvizServer from 'shellviz/server';

const server = new ShellvizServer({
    port: 8080,
    showUrl: true
});
```

## Running multiple instances
It is possible to run multiple instances of Shellviz by initializing instances with different ports:

```python
from shellviz import Shellviz

sv1 = Shellviz(port=5000)
sv2 = Shellviz(port=6000)

sv1.log('sending to the first server')
sv2.log('sending to the second server')
```

```javascript
import { ShellvizClient } from 'shellviz';

const analytics = new ShellvizClient({ port: 5544 });
const debug = new ShellvizClient({ port: 5545 });

analytics.table(analyticsData, 'metrics');
debug.log('Debug information');
```


On initialization, the Shellviz instance makes a quick check to see if another instance is running on the specified port. If it is, the request will be forwarded to the original server.

## Remote Server Connection

By default, Shellviz serves data and connects to a local server running on `http://localhost:5544`. However, the client can be configured to send data and listen to a remote server.

To send data to a remote server, initialize Shellviz with the `url` pointing to the remote url:
```python
from shellviz import Shellviz

# Connect to remote Shellviz instance
sv = Shellviz(url="https://shellviz.mycompany.com")
sv.log("Data from remote client")
```

```javascript
import { ShellvizClient } from 'shellviz';

// Connect to remote Shellviz instance
const client = new ShellvizClient({
    url: "https://shellviz.mycompany.com"
});
client.log("Data from remote client");
```


The client-side can be configured to connect to a remote URL by setting the `SHELLVIZ_URL` variable:

```html
<script>
SHELLVIZ_URL = 'https://shellviz.mycompany.com';
</script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/shellviz">
```

Setting up a remote server is straightforward! Simply initialize a new instance of Shellviz - either via the CLI or a script - and make it publicly accessible:

```bash
> shellviz
# serving on http://localhost:5544
```
