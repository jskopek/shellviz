Shellviz is the missing visual logger for your development workflow. While your code runs in the terminal or server, Shellviz streams the data to your browser in real-time â€“ creating an instant, interactive debugging and monitoring companion.

No dashboards to configure. No services to deploy. No dependencies to manage. Just add one import and transform raw data into charts, tables, progress bars, and more. It's like having a data scientist's notebook built into your print statements.

Want to see it in action? Click the "Run Example" button to see your first Shellviz call in action:

<CodeRunner code='shellviz.log("my first shellviz command");shellviz.table([["Alice", 25, 5.6], ["Bob", 30, 5.9], ["Charlie", 22, 5.7]]);shellviz.json({"name": "Alicez", "age": 25, "height": 5.6})'>
<CodeExample language="python" code={`from shellviz import log, table, json
log("my first shellviz command")
# Shellviz serving on http://192.168.86.124:5544
table([("Alice", 25, 5.6), ("Bob", 30, 5.9), ("Charlie", 22, 5.7)])
json({"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "height": 5.6})
`}/>
<CodeExample language="javascript" code={`import { log, table, json } from 'shellviz';
log('hello from Node.js');
table([['Name', 'Age'], ['Alice', 30], ['Bob', 25]]);
json({ message: 'JavaScript visualization!' });
`}/>
<CodeExample language="html" code={`<script src="https://unpkg.com/shellviz"></script>
<script>
const { log, show } = shellviz;
show(); // Display floating widget
log('hello from the browser');
</script>
`}/>
</CodeRunner>
